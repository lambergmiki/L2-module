# A simple RSS feed generator

## Generate HTML templates from RSS feeds

With the help of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml-js">xml-js</a>, RSS-URLs (which carry XML data) are converted into JavaScript objects. These are then processed and transformed into a RSS feed, packaged as a copy-and-paste template, ready to be embedded on your website.

The idea is to learn more about XML, RSS/Atom and create something useful for myself, while creating an (almost) independent module.
